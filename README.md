issue-tracker
=============
The Issue Tracker project is a useful tool for reporting issues that appear during software development and maintenance. Great utility for everyone who is a team member or contribute to a software project. All bugs, improvements, propositions of new features are stored in one place so that every developer is informed about any issues. The created web application as client uses REST WebServices. This enables many external applications (for example web and mobile apps) to be integrated with the Issue Tracker REST API.
